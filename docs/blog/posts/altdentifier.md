Hi Shimmering community,

We have received some unexpected news that requires our immediate attention and action. As of February 12, AltDentifier, our current security bot and CHH past bot, has announced its closure and will be merging into its sibling bot, Double Counter. This unforeseen development has caught us off guard, and we want to keep you informed about the necessary steps we need to take.


According to AltDentifier “Starting March 31, 2024, AltDentifier will be disconnected, and migration to Double Counter will be enforced.”

We understand that this sudden change may raise concerns, and we want to assure you that we are working diligently to ensure a smooth transition.


We recognize the importance of maintaining the security and integrity of our Network, and we believe that Double Counter will continue to provide the level of protection we expect.


While we acknowledge that this change is unexpected, we are committed to minimizing any disruption to our community operations. Our Network is actively involved in the migration process, and AltDentifier and the starlight higher up’s provide server owners with detailed instructions and support to ensure our community has a seamless transition.


We understand that change can be challenging, and we appreciate your understanding and cooperation during this time of transition. If you have any immediate concerns or questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to us or your server owner, in this case Jasper. We will keep them updated with any further developments and instructions as we approach the migration date. 

Thank you, Server Owner's for your continued dedication to maintaining a secure environment and You for an enjoyable environment within Starlight Gaming Network.
